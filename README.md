# Steganography PRO
Steganography is the technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary, non-secret, file or message in order to avoid detection. The secret data is then extracted at its destination. In this project LSB(Least Significant Bit) overriding technique is used.

## Basic Mode
In this mode user can hide 1 file in image with a password.

## Pro Mode
In this mode user can hide 2 file in Single image with different password.
Password supplied during extraction will decide which file will be extracted.
